# 🚦 NetrOn – Smart Vehicle Health Guardian

This project was developed as part of the **Tata InnoVent 2025** initiative. NetrOn is a low-cost IoT solution aimed at real-time health monitoring of two-wheelers. It captures critical data like engine temperature, vibration, and battery voltage using an Arduino-based sensor system, with data transmission via Bluetooth.

## 🔍 Project Overview

### ✅ Sensor-Based Monitoring with Arduino
Designed a modular sensor system using:
- **LM35** to measure engine temperature  
- **ADXL345** accelerometer to track unusual vibration patterns  
- **Voltage sensor** to monitor battery health  
- Data sent wirelessly via **HC-05 Bluetooth module**

### ✅ Flask Backend and UI (In Progress)
- Developed a basic Flask server to receive real-time data via serial input
- Created a simple HTML page to display live values (UI development ongoing)
- Dashboard mockup prepared for final integration  

### ✅ Deployment Plan
- Final system will integrate sensor data into a lightweight, mobile-friendly dashboard
- Goal: Real-time alerts to drivers via app or web interface for safety and maintenance
